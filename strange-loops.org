Powerful notations make knot theory easier

* Knot Theory
- Talk about knots in terms of crossings
- The simplest knot is a circle
- Links aren't knotes
- Knots are equivelent when they're twisted, or overlaped or twisted

* Briggs Notation
- Knots are complicated and visual
- Think about knots in terms of crossings
- Briggs notation compresses the knots too much

* Dowker notation
- Notate each crossing by following the path of the knots
- Say if the string passes over or under at the crossing
- Could have picked any crossing or picked any strand
- There isn't a one-to-one notation-to-knot system
- Every knot has a Dowker Notation
- Dowker notation can notate things which are not knots`

* Knots HIstory
- Lord Kelvin thought atoms might be knots

** TODO Find wikipedia knot notation tables

* Schools of Notation
- Knot break down
- Knot build up

* Conway Notation
- Knots are made of twists and tangles
- Tangles are described by cardinal directions
- Tangle become nots by connecting them in a circle
- Knots without Conway notation exist
- Using this notation you can generate them all on a computer!

** Tangle arithmatic
- Can add tangles by combing them
- Can multiply by rotating the first

** Knot applications
- Describes how DNA is tangled

* Equivalence
- You can look at knots as a continued fraction
- To check equivalence 
- This works for all *rational* knots
- Algebraic knots cannot be related by continued fraction equivalence

* Modern Tabulations
- Modern knot theorists use *Dowker* notations
- Dowker is compact but hard to manipulate
- Conway's system uses a large set of rules 
- It makes it hard to use in computer program

* Lessons
- Break down v Build up
- How easy for people?
- How easy for machines?
- Lots of rules? 
- Is there a one-to-one mapping? 
- What new manipulations does your notation encourage? 

** Try new notations!
