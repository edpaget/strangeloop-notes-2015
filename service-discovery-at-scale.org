#+TITLE: Service Discovery at Scale
#+AUTHOR: Nitesh Kant

* Service Discover?
- Service discovery invovled figure out which machines are running a particular service
- Static Mapping don't work since things in the cloud change all the time
- Need a dynamic mapping of names of services -> the machiens they run on
- Service discover is a central database that lets all the machines know where the other are

* Which machines have the software deployed?
- We can have machines self-report
- We can have machines heartbeat the discover service

* What happens if service discovery is down?
- Don't know about new nodes

* A co-ordination free service discovery service
** Client/Server interaction
- Startup/Shutdown/heartbeats
- Use a stateful protocol to handle the connection
- Heartbeats need to be bi-directional
** Data conflicts
- Seems like you don't resolve them
- Just order things temporarily
- Seems like this conflicts with advice about time in other talks
