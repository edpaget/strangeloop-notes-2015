* Papers
- Chemical Computer
- Principles of Chemical Computer
- Higher-Order Chemical Computing
- Building systems with higher-order chemical computing

** TODO Get Links to these papers

* Storytime
Basically everything computes. 
- You can can think of biological and chemical processes of ways of computing

* Goals
Innovation comes from this cross fertilization of ideas
Chemical computing is super new

* Intro to Chemical Computing
- Think of data in program as molecules
- Functions are 'reactions'
- Order doesn't matter
- Need to mix them over and over? 
- Converges on the answer?

** Gamma Chemical Programming
- Reaction Rules operates on a multi-sets of elements
- Has a condition + action
- Execution replacement with result emements
- Solution happens when reactions reach steady state

* Demo in ClojureScript
That was super cool!

* Higher-Order CC
- What is the reactions where also molecules?
- Molecules become functions + data
- Molecules 'hatch' in to functions + data after being appliced

** Reducing Reaction fuction
- Instead of hactching all the input data you can only less from the function molecule
- Need more stirring
- Allow functions to exchange captured valus

* Concurrency 
- Order does not matter in chemical computing
- So you can do things concurrently!

* Self-organization
When you create rules the systems that are generated become self-organizating

** Ie Mail Systems
- Membranes are inert molecules 
- they serve to separate part of the reaction

** Self-Healing
- Add a crash molecule that causes servers to crash
- Add a fix molecule that repairs crashed servers

* Lessons Learns
- It's all about the reations between functions and data
- It lets you get the heart of the logic 
- Lets you figure out how to eliminate the sequentiality of programming
- Gives you tools to reason about concurrency 

* Q&A
- No-experimenting with more complex routes
- Seems very similar to enterprise messages systems
