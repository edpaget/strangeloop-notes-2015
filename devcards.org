#+TITLE: Literate Interactive Coding: Devcards
#+AUTHOR: Bruce Hauman

The point of the talk is to try to reduce the feedback cycle.

* Problem
- The edit/reload recreate state cycle is *too* long

** Solution
- Hot code reloading
- Just write code that is reloadable

* New Problem
- You keep trying lots of different states

** Solution
- Devcards lets you have visual namespaces and code within

* Devcards
- Gives you a *lab* space
- Don't have to have a place in the app code to try things out

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  #_(str "this is a comment holy shit")
#+END_SRC

- Gives you the =defcard= macro
- Allows to you create a bunch of application states and see how they work
- Have the tests run within the devcards!
- Allows to write small tools using clojure's data structures to rewind and playback state
